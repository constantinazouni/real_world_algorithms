# Real-World Algorithms
The purpose of this repository is to host my assigments for the course "Algorithms and Data Structures" by professor [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas). After reading the book [
Real-World Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262035705/) and undertanding the theoretical background of the algorithms presented we were introduced to the following three assignments.

## Regular Crosswords
The objective of the first assignment is to create an algorithm that solves a crossword with a twist. In our case the crossword is not a regural one. Given a file of regural expression we need to fill the gaps of the crossword with the strings generated from those expressions.
